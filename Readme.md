### Sample Project to Learn about Artifact Management in Python

- learn to write CI/CD pipelines in GitHub and push deployment results into another GitHub repo for testing

##### Future Works

- expand to other programming languages such as C/C++, C#, JavaScript (maybe in another repo or try to write pipeline to handle projects of multiple languages in same repo)
- build python with other frameworks like Django.
